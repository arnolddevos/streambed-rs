streambed-rs - Event-driven services toolkit
===

Event-driven services
---

Event driven microservices promote responsiveness resulting in decisions being able to be made faster. Services also become more resilient to failure as they can quickly re-build their state by having events re-played.

Efficient
---

Streambed-based applications are designed to run at the edge on embedded computers as well as the cloud and so efficient cpu and memory usage are of primary concern.

Secure
---

Security is a primary consideration throughout the design of Streambed. For example, in the world of the Internet of Things, if an individual sensor becomes compromised then its effects can be minimized.

Built for integration
---

Streambed is a toolkit that promotes the consented sharing of data between many third-party applications. No more silos of data. Improved data availability leads to better decision making, which leads to better business.

Standing on the shoulders of giants, leveraging existing communities
---

Streambed is an assemblage of proven approaches and technologies that already have strong communities. Should you have a problem there are many people and resources you can call on.

Open source and open standards
---

Streambed is entirely open source providing cost benefits, fast-time-to-market, the avoidance of vendor lock-in, improved security and more.

Rust
---

Streambed build's on Rust's traits of writing fast and efficient software correctly.
